## Mad Libs
In this project, weâ€™ll use C# to write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs are short stories with blanks for the player to fill in that represent different parts of speech. The end result is a really hilarious and strange story.

Mad Libs require: A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words). Words from the player to fill in those blanks.
